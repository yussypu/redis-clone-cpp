# 🔥 Redis Clone in C++  
Built from scratch by [@yussypu](https://github.com/yussypu)

A lightweight, educational clone of Redis — implemented in modern C++ with support for in-memory storage, TTL, persistence, and a REPL interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ `SET` / `GET` key-value store
- ✅ `DEL`, `EXISTS`, `KEYS`, `FLUSHALL`
- ✅ `EXPIRE` & `TTL` (auto-expiring keys)
- ✅ In-memory REPL (CLI mode)
- ✅ TCP server (connect via `nc localhost 6379`)
- ✅ JSON-based persistence (`SAVE`, `LOAD`)
- ✅ Auto-save on exit, auto-load on startup
- ✅ Clean Makefile for easy build/run
- ✅ Colorful terminal UI & banner ✨

## 💠 Build Instructions

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- C++17 or later
- Make
- Netcat (`nc`) for testing TCP server

### ⚙️ Build & Run

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yussypu/redis-clone-cpp.git
cd redis-clone-cpp

# Build the project
make

# Run the TCP server (on port 6379)
make run

# OR use the built-in CLI REPL
make client
```

---

## 📡 Server Mode (TCP)

In one terminal:

```bash
make run
```

In another:

```bash
nc localhost 6379
```

Now type Redis-style commands:

```
SET name yahya
GET name
EXPIRE name 10
TTL name
```

---

## 💻 CLI Mode

```bash
make client
```

Enjoy a colorful REPL with full command support.

## 📂 Persistence

- Keys are saved to `dump.rdb` on exit
- Loaded automatically on startup
- Format is JSON (via [`nlohmann/json`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json))
